# Airbnb High Booking Rate Predictive Analysis with R Studio

### Objectives
This project entails a thorough modeling such as regression, Naïve Bayes, SVM, RandomForest, KNN and Boosting of a complicated airbnb dataset. Our objective is to predict high-booking-rate against test data’s target variable. In order to obtain maximum accuracy, procedures such as model selection, feature engineering, data cleaning and model construction are carefully implemented.

### Data Resource
We merged 'airbnb_train_x' and 'airbnb_train_y' as labeled airbnb dataset to predict unlabeled dataset 'airbnb_test_x'. There are 100000 records in training dataset and 12208 records in test dataset.

### Structure
Exploratory Analysis, Feature Engineering, Topic Modeling, Model Evaluation, Predictive Analysis
* Determining features for prediction
* Extracting Topics from `description` for each record
* Building supervised machine learning models
* Determining the best model based on accuracy

### Tools
R Studio, Python
